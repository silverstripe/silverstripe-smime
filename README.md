# Silverstripe S/MIME

**NOTE: This module is currently under active development, and is not yet ready
for use.**

This module enables Silverstripe CMS projects to use S/MIME when sending emails.
This is not a plug-and-play solution, as it depends on the provisioning and
configuration of a pair of SSL Certificates for encryption.

## Requirements

* SilverStripe ^4.6
* OpenSSL
* Certificates to encrypt

## Installation

```
composer require silverstripe/smime 1.x-dev
```

## License
